## About Me

I am an extrovert (sometimes even too much). I always prefer to work in a team rather than alone. With the same regularity I accept leadership in a team. One of my weaknesses is insecurity. I am constantly thinking about my future and sometimes fall into a deep stupor because of it. From RS School I am waiting for the very motivation that will improve my existing skills and open the door to the world of front-end development.

* CSS
* C
* JavaScript (Basics)

## Code Example

* ***CodeWars Kata***:

> Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci. As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) > numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

```javascript
function tribonacci(signature,n){
  let i = n;
  if(n == 0 || n == 1 || n == 2 || n == 3)
    {
      while(3 - i != 0)
        {
          signature.pop();
          i++;
        }
      return signature;
    }
  i = 3;
  while(i != n)
    {
      signature.push(signature[i - 1] + signature[i - 2] + signature[i - 3]);
      i++;
    }
  return signature;
}
```
